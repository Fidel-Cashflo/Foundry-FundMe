# FundMe Smart Contract

## Overview

The **FundMe** contract is a decentralized crowdfunding platform where users can fund a campaign using Ethereum (ETH). The contract ensures that each contribution meets a minimum value threshold (in USD) before being accepted. The owner of the contract can withdraw the funds at any time, and the contract includes optimized withdrawal mechanisms.

## Features

- **Funding:** Users can contribute ETH to the contract, which gets stored under their address. Contributions are only accepted if they meet a minimum USD value determined by a Chainlink Price Feed.
- **Ownership:** The contract has an owner who is the only one authorized to withdraw the accumulated funds.
- **Price Conversion:** The contract uses the Chainlink Price Feed to convert the ETH value to USD.
- **Optimized Withdrawals:** Includes both a basic and an optimized withdrawal function to efficiently manage gas costs when clearing the funders' list.
- **Fallback & Receive Functions:** The contract supports direct ETH transfers using fallback and receive functions.

## Prerequisites

- **Solidity Version:** 0.8.19
- **Dependencies:**
  - Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface for price feeds.
  - A deployed `PriceConverter` library for ETH to USD conversion.

## Deployment

To deploy the contract, you need to pass the address of a Chainlink Price Feed contract to the constructor:

```solidity
constructor(address priceFeed) {
    i_owner = msg.sender;
    s_priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeed);
}
```

### Example Deployment Script (using Foundry)

```solidity
import {DeployFundMe} from "deploy/DeployFundMe.s.sol";

// Deploy the FundMe contract with the appropriate Chainlink Price Feed address
```

## Functions

- **fund():** Allows users to contribute ETH to the contract. The contribution is only accepted if its value meets or exceeds the minimum threshold in USD.
  
- **withdraw():** Allows the contract owner to withdraw all funds and clear the funders' list. This is a straightforward withdrawal function.
  
- **cheaperWithdraw():** An optimized version of the `withdraw` function that reduces gas costs by clearing the funders' list in a more efficient manner.

- **getVersion():** Returns the version of the Chainlink Price Feed being used.

- **getAddressToAmountFunded(address):** Returns the total amount of ETH funded by a specific address.

- **getFunder(uint256):** Returns the address of the funder at a specific index in the funders' list.

- **getOwner():** Returns the address of the contract owner.

## Additional Concepts

This contract introduces several Solidity concepts, which will be covered in more detail in future sections:
1. Enums
2. Events
3. Try/Catch
4. Function Selector
5. `abi.encode` / `decode`
6. Hashing with `keccak256`
7. Yul / Assembly
